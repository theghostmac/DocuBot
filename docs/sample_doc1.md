# DocuBot Test Documentation

Welcome to the DocuBot test documentation! This is a sample markdown file that can be used to test the functionality of DocuBot's modules.

## Formatting Test

This is a paragraph with some **bold** and *italic* formatting. It also includes a [link](https://example.com) to test link extraction.

## Snippets Test

Here is an example of a code snippet in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
And here is a code snippet in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
console.log("Hello, world!");

Spellcheck Test

This is a paragraph with some misspelled words, such as "speling", "grammer", and "mispelled".

Please note that these misspelled words are intentional and included for testing the spell checking functionality of DocuBot.

That's it! This concludes the sample markdown file for testing DocuBot's modules.

You can use this markdown file as input to run the different modules of DocuBot, such as the formatting, snippets extraction, and spell checking modules, and validate the results against the expected output using the scripts in the `modules/` directory.
